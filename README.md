## General Information
- Over the course of 7 days, our group sought to develop a platform on which dog owners could connect with dog walkers and arrange for a walk. The resultant fullstack app allows users to see the walker's position and the area their dog is being walked around live on their browser.

## Technologies Used
- React.js
- Ruby On Rails
- Google Maps API
- Cloudinary to upload pet & profile images

## Features
- Ability to sign up and add your pets. 
- Arrange for a walker to come to your location and pick up your dog.
